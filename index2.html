                            Feeling lost and tired? Slowly take a deep breath and exhale. Pause for a while and allow yourself to rest. Everyone deserves to get their rest once in a while in order to be able to move forward again. Each day we get 24 hours and most of it goes to school, work, or sleep. However, do we still try to make time for ourselves despite our busy routines? Have no one to talk to? Try talking first to yourself. Reflect. Own and preserve your story, your life.

                            Still feeling lost and tired? Nothing beats a place which you could call home. Home is where you feel comfortable and secure with the company of your family. Family may be commonly regarded as a group of blood related people however it is not solely defined based on blood ties. Family can also refer to a group of people who support and love you and they include your friends.
